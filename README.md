The Github repository contains R code documentation and output file for **Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project**. In this project the input is data used is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The dataset is available at [UCI machine learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) The `run_analysis.R` script is downloading and tidying the data generating `tidydata.txt` file following the next 5 steps:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

For more information see the `codebook.md` file.
